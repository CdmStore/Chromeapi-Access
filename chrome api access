I sell access to my api.

Access to the chromeapi currently costs between 350 and 400 us.
but access to my chromeapi although it has a different method than other developers
works for exactly the same thing
downloads from netflix, amazon video, max, and disney+ and star+.
in a resolution of up to 4k for all platforms.

as I said before. My api was extracted with a different method than others. My API will allow you downloads without restrictions unlike other developers who restrict the resolution to exploit your pocketbook.
and steal more money from them with the excuse that the API could be banned. which is something ridiculous and meaningless. If they are banning it then why do they share it with those who pay them more?
